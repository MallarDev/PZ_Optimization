"""Jev directs the explore=restaurant scene (2026-09-25, the flip HDR "north-facing bloom" report) and the
explore=stairs scene (2026-09-25, walls flicker on the stairs: up to the top floor, down to the basement; the state
says "scene": "stairs") and the explore=circle scene with director=jev (2026-09-29, the gas-station shelves flicker while
the player walks in circles: circles round the start square and the aisles beside the shelves; "scene": "circle").

The game (pzopt.Explore, flags explore=restaurant director=jev) writes the scene's facts every 0.3 s to
~/Zomboid/pzopt-explore-state.json; this loop asks TypeSafe's Jev what the character does next and writes
"<seq> <action>" to ~/Zomboid/pzopt-explore-cmd.txt, which the game carries out until the next command. Jev only chooses;
the walking is the game's own movement keys along a grid path, doors opened on the way. Every decision goes to the log
with Jev's probabilities and latency.

    harness/explore-director.py [--machine flip] [--log /tmp/explore-director.log] [--wait 900]

--machine <m> (a [m] entry of harness/queue/machines.conf): the game runs there; one ssh connection streams its state
file here and carries the commands back (the TypeSafe key stays on this machine). Start it before the run (it waits for a
state file newer than itself); it exits when the state goes stale for 15 s (the run ended).
