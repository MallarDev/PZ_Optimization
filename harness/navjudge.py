"""Is the harness walk clean? (2026-10-08, the maintainer: "an error free and stuck free Jev powered harness to walk in the
game efficiently without colliding with any obstacle".)

Reads a walk run (pzopt.Nav under explore=mirror director=jev; the `harness: nav:` and `harness: mirror walk` lines) and
the director's log, and reports, over the walk (route start .. walk done):

  collisions        the player's collision episodes (the game's per-frame flags: wall, object, door, vehicle, bump state)
  stuck             walking with under 0.15 squares of progress in 1.5 s
  failed_legs       walks that ended without arriving (after the one retry), retries, lost walks (the action left the queue)
  errors            ERROR / exception / stack-trace lines in the game log during the walk (the start-up noise before the
                    route is not counted), Lua errors of the walk bridge (lua_errors)
  director_errors   lines of the director's log that are not decisions (tracebacks, failed calls)
  efficiency        walked / straight distance over the arrived legs, seconds a leg, the walk's share of stations visited
  done              the walk ended with its summary line (not the harness's time limit)

The game rotates console.txt on long, chatty runs: when the run's console.txt lacks the walk, the newest
~/Zomboid/Logs/*/…_DebugLog.txt holding the run's label window is read (or pass --log).

  python3 harness/navjudge.py <run> [--log <game log>] [--director /tmp/x.log] [--json out.json] [--no-jev]
Exit 0 when clean (no collision, stuck, failed leg, error), 1 otherwise.
