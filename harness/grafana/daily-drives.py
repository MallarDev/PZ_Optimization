"""Check the daily re-measure runs (labels <bench>-<MMDD>-<n> / <bench>-stock-<n>, dashboards.DAILY_BENCHES) before they
count in the home chart.

  harness/grafana/daily-drives.py [run dirs or globs...]   # default: every daily bench's runs under /tmp/pzopt-daily-*, ~/pzopt-wt/daily-* and harness/runs

Bench runs (no drive lines): BAD = route not complete. Drive runs: route status, distance, the largest distance off the line and any speed drop of more than 40 km/h from above
60 km/h, from the console's 1 Hz `harness: drive t=` lines, and the route-mean fps. BAD = not complete, > 10 tiles off
the line or such a drop: its fps is not the drive's (a crash changes the scenery, a parked car renders 750+ fps). A hit
always shows as the drop; the pre-09-22 road follower swings 7-9 tiles through the wide start stretch at full speed
without touching anything, hence 10 rather than the 8 of the 2026-09-23 crash notes. Put the
BAD ones in release-days.json "excluded" with the reason, regenerate the dashboards.
