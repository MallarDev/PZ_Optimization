"""Is every dashboard element displayed correctly in Chrome? Headless Chrome renders each dashboard, Jev judges each panel.

ui-check.mjs (Node's built-in WebSocket, Chrome DevTools protocol) opens each page in google-chrome-stable --headless at
the screen width with a tall window, so every panel renders, and extracts per panel: its visible text, "No data" / error
markers, whether each canvas drew anything, text the browser clips, overlaps with other panels, the legend; on the home
page it also moves the pointer across the daily chart and records the tooltip. Jev (typesafe_client, text only) gets
each panel's facts with its title, type and description from the generated dashboard JSON and answers ok /
no_data / error / clipped / blank_chart / overlap / wrong_content; a page-level question covers horizontal scrolling and
the hover. Screenshots and report.json go to --out. Exit 0 when Jev passes everything.
