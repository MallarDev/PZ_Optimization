/**
 * A batched entity's lazy light reads, made worker-safe (entityUpdateParallel, 2026-09-27).
 *
 * <p>A zombie updated on a frame worker reads its square's light (the visibility test of {@code updateSeenVisibility},
 * {@code spottedNew}); the first read of a square in a lighting pass is {@code JNILighting.update}, which rewrites the
 * square's light fields and then marks the chunk level dirty, feeds LightDirt / the puddle batch / the cutaway check and
 * runs the room / meta "square seen" hooks. Per-level flags written by two workers at once lose updates, and the hooks
 * touch rooms, zones and the music system. PR #35 left these on the worker. On a batch task the refresh of one square
 * now runs under that {@code JNILighting}'s monitor (two zombies on one square), and every side effect is appended to the
 * task's own list here, which the game thread runs at the join in task (= stock) order. The light values themselves are
 * the native's pure reads, the same whichever thread asks first.
