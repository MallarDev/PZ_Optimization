/**
 * The zombies' action-context transition evaluation on the other cores ({@code actionEvalParallel}, 2026-09-22,
 * docs/plan-zombie-multithread.md §3.2 step 2).
 *
 * <p>Every frame every animating zombie's {@code ActionContext.update()} evaluates the transitions of its current
 * action state (and of its sub-states): tens of conditions, each a variable lookup and a callback into the zombie,
 * then a compare. It was 7-10 % of the game thread on the Louisville horde after the typed-operand rewrite. The
 * evaluation only reads the zombie (its variables, its target's position, the event set of the context) and writes
 * the context's own "next" container, so it can run on the {@link FrameBatch} workers; the state change itself
 * (history, enter / exit hooks, the events) and everything after it in {@code postUpdateAnimating} (the animator, the
 * model slot, the light info) must stay on the game thread in the original order.
 *
 * <p>The postupdate loop is split in two by the {@code MovingObjectUpdateScheduler} override:
 * <ol>
 * <li>the loop itself: every object's {@code postupdate()} as before, but an eligible zombie's {@code postUpdateAnimating}
 *     stops after the forward direction, aim angle and turning flags (the inputs the conditions read) and queues the
 *     zombie here ({@link #submit});</li>
 * <li>{@link #flush}: the queued contexts evaluate on the workers into their "next" containers; then, on the game
 *     thread and in queue order, each zombie runs the rest of its {@code postUpdateAnimating}
 *     ({@code pzoptPostUpdateAnimatingRest}: the {@code ActionContext.update()} override finds the evaluation done and
 *     only applies it, then the animator and the model update as stock).</li>
 * </ol>
 * The bone batch ({@code AnimBatch}) collects its work during step 2 and runs after it, as before.
 *
 * <p>Not queued (stock path inline): players and animals, multiplayer, a zombie being grappled / grappling / that
 * reanimated a player (its counterpart reads it in the same loop), and any zombie whose current state or sub-states
 * have a transition condition other than a variable compare or an event test (a {@code LuaCall} runs Lua). A
 * condition callback reached from a worker must not touch shared scratch: {@code IsoZombie.isFacingTarget} is the
 * one that did (static vectors), fixed in the IsoZombie override. {@code devActionEvalCheck=true} re-evaluates every
 * queued context on the game thread at apply time and counts disagreements ({@code mismatches}), which is the
 * determinism rig of this phase (two runs of the game are never frame-aligned, so a run-to-run checksum cannot be).
