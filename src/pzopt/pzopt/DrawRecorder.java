/**
 * One tile draw unit's recorded draw list (tileRecordParallel, docs/plan-louisville-120-structural.md change A).
 *
 * <p>While a thread records a unit, {@code SpriteRendererStates.getPopulatingActiveState} hands it this recorder's own
 * {@link RecState} instead of the frame's populating state, and {@code IOpenGLState.set} checks this recorder's own GL
 * state cache instead of the game thread's. The game thread then splices the unit into the populating state in stock
 * order ({@link #splice}): the entries move over by reference, and the stream that comes out is the one the stock
 * pass would have written, entry for entry:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>The first set of a GL state in a segment is <em>conditional</em>: the recorder cannot know the game thread's
 * cache at that point of the stream, so it records only the value, and the splice runs the stock set there against the
 * game thread's cache (issuing the entry when stock would have).</li>
 * <li>An object a recording thread may not draw is <em>deferred</em>: the recorder notes it, and the splice draws it
 * on the game thread, through the stock path, at its place in the stream. Before it, the game thread's GL cache takes
 * every value the segment set; after it, the recorder's cache counts as unknown again (the deferred object may have
 * changed any state), so the next sets are conditional.</li>
 * <li>A tree flush point: where stock would draw the pending tree batch before a non-tree object
 * ({@code FBORenderCell.renderTranslucent(square, layer)}), the recorder notes it and the splice flushes the game
 * thread's {@code FBORenderTrees.current} there (trees are deferred, so pending trees only exist on the game thread).</li>
 * </ul>
