/**
 * Lua on the frame workers (luaWorkerGate, 2026-10-01). Kahlua has one stack per KahluaThread and the game runs all its
 * Lua on LuaManager.thread from the game thread. Our batches move zombie work onto {@link FrameBatch.Worker}s; a Lua call
 * reached from there (a mod's function the zombie update calls: a hook, a global-object system such as farming's
 * destroyPlant when a zombie tramples a crop) pushed onto that shared stack beside the game thread: Kahlua's
 * "Lua code called from the wrong thread" and, with a second worker, a corrupted stack (ArrayIndexOutOfBounds -2,
 * the maintainer's farm save, 2026-09-28). Events were already captured and replayed (UpdateBatch); this covers every
 * other Java -> Lua call, at the one door they all use (the LuaCaller override):
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>a void call inside the entity update batch joins that task's Lua replay: it runs on the game thread after the
 *       join, in stock's serial order (UpdateBatch.captureLuaCall);
 *   <li>any other call waits on the worker while the game thread runs it: at its next task boundary or while it waits
 *       in a join (FrameBatch). The game thread never sits inside Lua at those points, so the stack stays its own.
 *       After {@link #TIMEOUT_NS} with nobody taking it (a game thread blocked elsewhere) the worker runs the call
 *       itself, which is what happened before this gate; counted and logged.
 * </ul>
 *
 * Counters on the FBORenderCell log line ({@link #describe}); the first call per Lua file is logged with the file, so a
 * mod's function reached from a worker shows up in console.txt by name.
