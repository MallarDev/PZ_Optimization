/**
 * The vision cone's polygon computed while the game thread renders the world ({@code visPolyAsync}, 2026-09-27; the
 * plan-resource-use item 3a).
 *
 * <p>{@code VisibilityPolygon2.renderMain} (late in the tile render, at the camera's level) recomputes the shadow polygon
 * of the player's vision cone whenever the player moved or turned, i.e. every frame while walking, driving or spinning: a
 * walk over the loaded chunks' wall lists (rebuilt when a neighbour loaded) and the view-cone tests. Its inputs are the
 * frame's camera, the player's position, facing and vision cone, the chunks' on-screen levels and wall lists: all final
 * once the cell render's checks ran, and nothing in the tile render changes them. So the game thread starts it on this
 * pass's thread right before performRenderTiles and renderMain takes the finished drawer (the stock calculation, the same
 * drawer object); a worker never creates a chunk's render levels (a chunk without them has never been on screen). One
 * player only (the drawer's static scratch).
