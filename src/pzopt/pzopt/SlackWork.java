 * {@code slackWork} (2026-10-05, Louisville 120 fps pass): deferrable game-thread work run in the frame's slack. At a frame
 * cap the game thread ends most steps early and parks until the next one (Pacing.limiterWait). Work that may wait a few
 * frames (a far chunk's hand-off, far containers' loot rolls, far zombies turning real) is queued by its producer and run
 * here, one job at a time, while the job's estimated cost fits the time left before the next step (less
 * {@code slackMarginUs}). The producers learn their costs as they run (a running mean per kind of job), and a job that has
 * waited {@code slackMaxWaitFrames} runs whatever its cost, so nothing starves. Uncapped (no slack) the producers keep their
 * in-frame budgets.
