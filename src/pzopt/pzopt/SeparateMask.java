/**
 * The "is this square blocked to that neighbour" answers of the separation pass, cached for one frame
 * ({@code separateFast}, 2026-09-22).
 *
 * <p>{@code IsoMovingObject.separate()} asks {@code current.isBlockedTo(nav[i])} for each of the eight neighbouring
 * squares that hold a moving object, once per character per frame. The answer only depends on the geometry of the two
 * squares and, for a diagonal, of the two squares between them (walls, windows, doors, stair tops) — never on the
 * character asking. On the Louisville horde several hundred zombies stand on a few hundred squares, so the same
 * answer was computed three to eight times a frame; {@code isBlockedTo} and its recursive diagonal calls were 1.7 % of
 * the game thread.
 *
 * <p>A direct-mapped table keyed by square identity holds, per square and per frame, which of the eight answers have
 * been computed and what they were. Entries are computed lazily (a square whose neighbours hold nobody still costs
 * nothing) and expire with the frame, so a door that opens mid-frame is seen on the next one — a separation push is
 * never visible at that granularity. A collision in the table simply recomputes.
