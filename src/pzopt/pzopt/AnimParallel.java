/**
 * The zombies' animator and model update on the frame workers ({@code animatorParallel}, 2026-09-22 night).
 *
 * <p>After {@link ActionEval} has evaluated every queued zombie's transitions, stock finishes each zombie in turn on the
 * game thread: the state change ({@code ActionContext.update}), the animator ({@code AdvancedAnimator.update}: node
 * conditions, blend weights, transitions, the anim events of the node timelines), the move deltas and the model update
 * (the track tick, which fires the track events, then the bone math that {@link AnimBatch} already moved). That was 9-12
 * % of the game thread on the Louisville horde. The animator and the tick only touch the character's own animation
 * objects, read-only anim sets, thread-safe pools and its variables; what they reach outside the character goes through
 * the anim events. So the finish is split in three:
 * <ol>
 * <li>game thread, queue order: the state change, and the eligibility test below; an eligible zombie is armed;</li>
 * <li>frame workers: each armed zombie's animator, move deltas and model update, with its anim events captured
 *     ({@link AnimCapture}) instead of dispatched and the tracks it removes held unreleased;</li>
 * <li>game thread, queue order: an armed zombie gets its captured events dispatched (stock's handlers: sounds,
 *     footsteps, variables, the state's anim-event hook, the context's event set) around the context's event clear, as
 *     stock orders them; a zombie that was not armed runs its animator and model update here, as stock.</li>
 * </ol>
 * The bone batch collects during step 2 as it did during stock's loop and starts after step 3.
 *
 * <p>Exactness: a zombie whose animator step fired an event (a footstep, a variable set, a sound) stops on the worker
 * right after the animator and does the rest on the game thread once its events are dispatched, so everything after
 * the animator sees the handlers' effects like stock. Events of the track tick are dispatched after the tick instead of
 * inside it (the tick of the other tracks of the same character no longer sees a handler's effect in the same frame).
 *
 * <p>Not armed: players, animals, anything {@link AnimBatch} would not batch (a ragdoll, a recorder, a parent player),
 * a character with no square, and a zombie whose current anim states (or its live nodes) name a variable callback with
 * side effects in a condition, a scalar, a speed scale or a track-time variable ({@link ActionEval#impureCallback}):
 * those callbacks clear the target, drop the thump target, rescan corpses or run a pathfind line test, and must run on
 * the game thread in stock's order. A zombie whose animator step on the worker left a ragdoll track (a hit or a death)
 * also stops right after the animator: the model update would start or step the ragdoll (the wall slide through
 * PolygonalMap2's shared collision scratch, the ragdoll pool, the physics world), which is game-thread work
 * ({@code serialRagdoll=}; before it the model update ran on the worker and only skipped the ragdoll step for that frame,
 * and older releases created the controller there: ArrayIndexOutOfBounds in CollideWithObstacles). The callbacks themselves carry a guard ({@link #impureGuard}): reached on a
 * worker anyway, they throw before any side effect and the zombie finishes on the game thread; the count is in the log
 * ({@code impure=}) and has to stay 0.
