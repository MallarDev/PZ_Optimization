/**
 * floorDecalsPerFrame (2026-10-05, the maintainer: "manholes flicker zoomed out all the way, walking in the rain"). Stock draws
 * Translucent tiles per frame, after the puddles, so a manhole cover or a drain lying in a puddle always covers the water. Baked
 * (translucentTilesInChunkTexture), the cover sits in the chunk texture under the puddle pass, which is depth-tested against it:
 * the cover's object depth lies within the puddle's 1e-4 lift over the floor, and the puddle and the cover traded places in
 * horizontal bands that moved with the camera's sub-pixel offset (runs manhole-*, street_decoration_01_15). A tile lies on the
 * floor when its sprite's opaque rectangle fits in the floor diamond at the bottom of the tile (the diamond is half the tile's
 * width high), with a sixteenth of the width above it for a rim; those stay per frame as in stock on squares that draw
 * puddles (the rest stay baked: +200 tile draws a frame on the spin route when every floor-lying tile went per frame). The
 * sprite answer is cached once its texture's size is known.
