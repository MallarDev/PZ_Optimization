## What it looks like

![AO on (top) and off (bottom), Rosewood house, zoom 1](media/ao-rosewood-on-vs-off.jpg)

Soft occlusion where surfaces meet: floors darken along wall bases and in room corners, under and around furniture,
beds, sofas, shelves, stairs, fences, bushes and trees; the outer wall of a house gets a crease on the pavement.
Characters and vehicles keep their own shadows (they are not in the chunk textures). Screenshot rig: bench at the
Rosewood house `--flag start=8147,11507 --flag zoom=1 --flag route=S:30 --flag speed=1 --shot-at 3`, with
`--prop devAoView=1` for the AO term alone.

## The depth is a world-space height field

The FBO renderer's depth is linear in world space (`IsoDepthHelper`: `C - (x + y + 2z) * SQUARE_DEPTH / 2`) under an
orthographic 2:1 projection. A square is `32 sqrt(2) tileScale / zoom` screen pixels across (90.5 at tileScale 2,
zoom 1), and one unit of depth is 424.27 squares along the view (`cos 30 cos 45 / (SQUARE_DEPTH / 2)`); a level is
2.449 squares tall. Checked on a dumped depth buffer: the ground slope is 6.767e-5 per pixel (predicted 6.766e-5),
a wall face 2.25e-5 (predicted 2.26e-5). So every depth texel is an exact view-space position and the AO is computed
in true 3D, with no normal buffer.

## Kernel

Ground-truth-style horizon AO with visibility bitmasks (Therrien, Levesque, Gilet 2023): per slice, 32 sectors of the
hemisphere around the projected normal, equal in cosine-weighted solid angle (`sin` of the angle from the normal),
each sample covering the sectors between its front and an assumed back `aoThicknessPct` behind it; thin posts occlude
as little as they cover and a depth jump beyond the radius is no occluder (no halos). Trig-free form: the sector of a
slice vector is `sin(a - n)` from two dot products with the normalised vector (identical to the atan/sin form on a
dumped frame, max difference 0). Two slices per texel rotated over a 4x4 Bayer tile (32 directions), four steps per
side, a 4x4 depth-aware box over one tile period.

Specific to sprite depth:
- normals from 2-pixel differences (the chunk textures are drawn at zoom scale: one-pixel steps alternate 2:1) snapped
  to the three planes tiles are made of (ground, east wall, south wall) when within ~20 degrees (87 % of pixels);
- a 0.04-square height bias: occluders barely above the tangent plane are ignored;
- tile edge rows are written ~0.02 squares behind their neighbours: a centre texel behind both neighbours on an axis
  by less than 0.05 squares is filled (else a dark line along every chunk diamond edge);
- a neighbour texture's overlapping edge lies ~0.05 squares in front of ours: the centre takes the nearest of all
  sources (the surface the composite shows); taps take the texture's own depth where it has a pixel.

## Screen mode first: 90-140 us a frame

`aoMode=screen` runs the kernel on the scene depth right after the chunk composite (the scene then holds exactly the
static world) and multiplies the scene. Desktop (RTX 4090, 5120x2160, DLSS 67 % = 3413x1440 world), uncapped walking
route: AO 105 us + blur 13 + apply 25 at 50 %, 62 + 6 + 23 at 25 %; 500 -> 450 fps. Probes: a pass that reads one
depth texel costs 15 us, one that reads none 8 us; the trig-free kernel changed nothing, the apply early-out neither.
Fixed per-pass cost dominates on this driver, so any per-frame full-screen AO stays well above "nothing".

## Chunk mode: baked into the chunk textures

The static world is drawn into chunk-level textures when they bake and only composited every frame, so the AO is
computed per texture and multiplied into its colour; frames that bake nothing pay nothing, a moving camera pays
nothing. Pieces, each found necessary by measurement:

- The multiply runs at the end of every bake while the texture's framebuffer is bound (before the stock mipmap build).
  The AO depends on the depth only, so lighting-only re-bakes (the frequent kind) reuse the kept R8 AO.
- Computes (a new texture, changed objects / cutaways / trees) run inside the bake up to `aoBakeBudget` per frame
  (no ratio, no mip work: the stock mipmap build follows), else deferred (`aoComputeBudget` per frame) and applied later as a ratio new / old (blend `DST_COLOR, SRC_COLOR` =
  2 src dst, lightens and darkens) with only the mip levels the current zoom / render scale samples (the rest
  re-bake when the player zooms out past them). `glGenerateMipmap` costs ~65 us per 1024 texture here, and every
  framebuffer re-attachment ~3 us.
- Occluders across the chunk edge: the kernel reads the eight neighbour textures of the same level pair and zoom at
  their composite offsets and chunk depth offsets. Neighbours computed without a new texture get one refresh (after 8
  frames, one for the whole streaming wave), and only when something but floor stands on the new chunk's border squares
  facing them (the only place within the radius). An 8-frame wait before a new texture's own first compute did not
  reduce the refreshes (2,239 vs 2,272) and was dropped.
- The first multiply after a compute runs under an occlusion query; a texture with no occlusion skips its later
  multiplies.
- The `redraw` dirty flag (a level back on screen, water shader toggles, light switches) is not a geometry change
  (6,000 of them in a 25 s storm run).

## Cost (desktop, RTX 4090, 5120x2160, DLSS at 67 %, uncapped; `devAoTiming`, route window, `/tmp/ao/routecost.sh`)

| scene | AO GPU time | frame time |
|---|---|---|
| standing still, or a camera that only moves | 0 (nothing bakes) | = |
| walking through Rosewood, 3 tiles/s (`ao-f-walk-s50`, `ao-h-walk`) | 4.1-4.2 us / frame (0.27 % at 650 fps) | = |
| 120 km/h path drive south at max zoom (`ao-m-drive`) | 12.9 ms / s = 1.3 % | 2.4 ms mean both, p99 11.3 (AO) vs 11.5 (off), `ao-k-drive-on/off` |
| storm preset route (18 tiles/s run + spin: 75 new chunk textures / s, cutaways) (`ao-m-storm`) | 12.9 ms / s = 1.3 % | fps within the run-to-run noise (off: 246-264) |

Per job: a compute is ~25 us of kernel + 5 of box + 7 of multiply inside a bake (+ ~20 us of ratio / copy / mip
levels when deferred), a lighting re-bake's multiply ~6 us. The remaining cost scales with jobs, not texels:
`aoScalePct=25` gave 12.50 ms/s against 12.87 at 50 % on the storm route, and a pass that reads nothing costs ~8 us
on this driver. The loop's steps, storm route cost in ms of GPU per second (per-frame figures before the metric
changed): screen mode 90-140 us / frame -> chunk mode with context pass 14.2 ms/s -> scissored context, deferred
creations 14.3 -> in-bake creations 14.3 -> bare-border refresh skip + in-bake budget 4: 12.9. The 25 % default was
rejected: blockier contact edges for a 3 % saving.

Quality check: `devAoView=1` shots (the AO term alone) and the on / off brightness ratio at the Rosewood house (no
chunk seams after the centre / pit / bias fixes; offline check of the kernel and the fixes on dumped depth with numpy,
`devAoDumpFrame`). Max zoom-out keeps the AO (mip levels).

## Frame-time tail (the objective's metric)

Capped 240 fps drive-120-south (bench args, game-thread bound: game load 94 %, GPU 60 %):

| | fps | p99 | p99.9 | max |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AO off (`ao-cap-off1/2`) | 217.9 / 217.9 | 14.7 / 14.2 ms | 36.0 / 33.3 | 51.5 / 53.4 |
| AO on, fixed budgets (up to 4 in-bake + 2 deferred a frame, `ao-cap-on1/2`) | 214.0 / 215.9 | 16.4 / 15.4 ms | 37.3 / 36.9 | 196 / 54.8 |
| AO on, slack gating (`ao-cap-on3..6`) | 220.1-220.4 | 14.2-14.8 ms | 31.4-36.6 | 46.8-52.9 |

The computes landed on the slowest frames (streaming bursts). Now, under a cap, a frame gets as many computes as the
last frame's slack fits (~60 us each), none in bakes after a frame that missed the cap, and one deferred compute every
8 such frames; the deferred queue serves the textures composited this frame first. Trade-off: on this drive most frames
miss the 240 cap (the game thread), so the queue peaks at ~340 textures and new chunks show their AO late while the
car races at max zoom; it drains when the player slows down. (Fixed 2026-09-25, see "Late grass while driving" below: a new texture's first AO is now computed in its bake.) One compute on every slow frame (`aoSlowFrameComputes=1`)
barely shortened the queue (325) and one of two runs read p99 16.1 ms, so the default stays the trickle. Uncapped play
keeps the fixed budgets.

## Other GPUs

The Mac's game runs a legacy OpenGL 2.1 context (Apple's Metal-backed GL, GLSL 1.20): `#version 140` is refused, the
feature logs the compile error and switches itself off, the game runs normally (the fog pass is in the same position).
A GLSL 1.20 kernel would need the bitmask without integer operations. The flip (AMD / Mesa) was offline.

## Default

Off: a deliberate change of the picture (peers' visual-parity judges compare stock and optimized pictures), one tick
box in Options > Optimizations > "Ambient occlusion" to turn on.

## Strength per surface (2026-09-25)

The single `aoStrengthPct` became three keys (four since the vegetation one below) on the Options > Enhancements tab: `aoStrengthFloorPct`,
`aoStrengthWallPct`, `aoStrengthObjectPct` (0 / 50 / 75 / 100 / 150, default 100). The AO kernel already snaps the
reconstructed normal to the ground or one of the two wall planes (dot > 0.94); that class picks the strength, applied
to the computed occlusion before the blur (`1 - (1 - vis) * s`), so the kept R8 AO carries it and the multiply / ratio
passes run at 1. Everything that is neither floor nor wall (furniture, fences, stairs, bushes) is "objects". An unset
key takes `aoStrengthPct`, so options files from before keep their look. Same in `aoMode=screen`. No cost: one select
per computed texel. Check (runs `enh-aosplit-default` / `enh-aosplit-floor`, `devAoView=1`, `--shot-at 3` at the
Rosewood spot): floors 150 / walls 0 / objects 0 leaves walls, chairs, shelves and bushes white and darkens only the
floor under and around them.

A fourth, `aoStrengthVegetationPct` (chunk mode only; screen mode counts vegetation as objects): the chunk depth has no
stencil or spare channel to tag vegetation in the bake, so the kernel reconstructs an "object" pixel's square from its own
depth (`calculateDepth` is k (20 - (x + y) - 2z) within the chunk, k = 0.023093667 / 16) and its texture position (x - y
from the column, (x + y) 16 - z 96 world px from the row) and looks it up in a per-compute mask built on the game thread:
16 x 16 squares (the chunk and 4 around it), one plane per level for bushes / grass / flowers (`isBush`, `canBeRemoved`,
`vegitation`), one for tree crowns at any height (a tree marks the squares its crown spans along its screen row, 3 each
side). The mask is only built (and the lookup only runs) when the vegetation strength differs from the objects one.
Check `enh-aoveg` (vegetation 0, objects 150, `devAoView=1`): bush and tree bodies white, the ground under them and the
fence shaded; a few twig-tip pixels at bush tops stay shaded (their depth slope reads as floor or wall).

### Plants: no leaf-on-leaf shading, their own strength (issue #40, 2026-09-29)

Report: foliage far too dark in daylight at the default 100 / 100, "the floor and vegetation strengths apply twice".
AO-term shots (`devAoView=1`, the Rosewood house spot, one strength at 150 and the rest 0; runs `i40-aofloor`,
`i40-aoveg`) showed four things: (1) the bulk of it: bush and grass bodies came out speckled grey to black, every leaf
texel's horizon seeing the leaves next to it (the tree cards were exempted from the horizon for this reason, the plants
were not); (2) plant texels whose depth slope snaps to the ground plane take the floor strength (black speckle inside
bush outlines, on top of the intended contact ring on the ground); (3) the crown shade under trees (up to 50 % x the
vegetation strength, 31 % darker at 100 than at 50 on the reporter's road); (4) grey bands on a house wall behind a
hedge with the wall strength at 0.

`aoPlantLeafOcclusion` (default off = the fix): a plant texel (on a plant square of its level, not snapped to a plane)
skips horizon taps that land on a plant's or a crown's square above that square's floor (reconstructed level not within
0.06 of a whole level); the ground, walls, fences and furniture still occlude it. The vegetation mask is now built whenever
AO is on (it was only built when the vegetation and object strengths differed). The kernel's lookup returns plant (planes
0-2) or crown (plane 3), so the old single vegetation strength splits: `aoStrengthVegetationPct` is the trees' (card,
crown squares, crown shade, TreeShade) and the new `aoStrengthPlantPct` the bushes', grass' and flowers' (unset: the
vegetation value, so options files keep their look). Every AO strength also offers 25 %. Defaults unchanged (100).

Same build, runs `i40b-*` (`--install` of the worktree): plants 150, the rest 0, AO term: mean darkening over the bush
strip 0.092 -> 0.026, texels darker than 0.5 6.4 % -> 0.3 %; the wall bands and the fence shading went with it (they were
leaf taps too: wall / fence texels on a hedge square that miss the plane snap are classed as plants). Default strengths,
normal view: bush strip brightness 63.8 -> 70.4 (road 104.8 / 105.7, unchanged). Kernel 28-37 us a compute in all four
runs (no cost measurable). Left: (2) and (3) above.

## Late grass while driving (2026-09-25)

Report: "grass rendered late when driving fast with AO on". The AO is what shades the ground under and around grass
tufts and bushes, and a new chunk texture's first AO went through the same slack gate as every other compute: after a
frame that missed the cap no in-bake computes and one deferred compute every 8 frames. On `drive-120-south` a third of
the frames miss the cap, so new textures reached the screen flat and pale and darkened up to seconds later (the grass
"growing in" behind the road edge). `ChunkAo.latency()` now counts it (`ao_latency=` in `pzopt-bench.out`): per texture
the time from its first bake to its first AO, and the texture-frames composited without it.

`aoArrivalInBake` (default on): a texture's first AO is computed inside that first bake whatever the slack or
`aoBakeBudget` (the bake scheduler's arrival quota and hard budget already bound those bakes); changed objects and
neighbour refreshes keep the slack gate. Same build, `drive-120-south --record`, 240 cap (runs `aog-*`):

| | first AOs in the bake | waited > 1 s | mean wait | texture-frames without AO | frames showing one | fps | p99 | p99.9 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| old (`aoArrivalInBake=false`, `aog-old-1/2`) | 1,070 / 2,364, 1,933 / 3,177 | 895, 370 | 786, 240 ms | 569,716, 144,886 | 38 %, 26 % | 187.2, 226.5 | 17.2, 10.5 ms | 25.8, 18.6 ms |
| fix (`aog-fix-1/2`) | 3,253 / 3,256, 3,277 / 3,280 | 3, 3 | 1.2, 1.3 ms | 282, 284 | 1.1 %, 1.1 % | 225.3, 225.2 | 11.5, 10.8 ms | 18.9, 20.1 ms |
| AO off (`aog-off-1/2`) | | | | | | 219.5, 228.8 | 12.0, 9.9 ms | 20.4, 18.9 ms |

About 1,600 first AOs a run went past the old budget. Enclosed black (holes.py) 0.87-0.90 % in the fix runs vs 0.89-1.01
% old and 0.92-0.94 % off; no chunk-ahead stall in any of the six. Jev (`harness/ao-late-judge.py`, numbers only): issue
in control yes 0.95, fixed in test yes 0.89, tail regressed 0.08, arrival regressed 0.08, verdict fixed (0.89). The three
textures a run that still wait, and all 282-284 texture-frames without AO, fall in the first 1,800 frames (world
load, settle, first ~4 s of the route); none after. `aog-old-1` is the slow outlier of the
six (187 fps); the other old run is at the fix's level, so the fix's frame-time effect is within noise.
