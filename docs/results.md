# Results

Fresh start on 2026-09-24. Every earlier result (the old `results.md`, the findings, the baselines and the last
`benchmark-progress.html` snapshot) is in `docs/archive/2026-09-24/` and `harness/archive/2026-09-24/`; the run
directories behind them are in `harness/archive/2026-09-24/runs/` (local only).

The metrics of every run from here on are in Grafana (`harness/grafana/stack.sh up`, http://127.0.0.1:3000):
per-frame times, presented frames and GPU time, utilization, game-thread phases, chunk latency, GC, flips and
Jev's verdict. This file keeps the prose: what was run, why, and what it showed. Each entry names its runs, so
the dashboards "PZ run" / "PZ compare" show the numbers behind it, and states the frame tail (p99 / p99.9 /
spikes / jitter) and the utilization over the route window, as the objective requires.

## 2026-09-24 afternoon: sound engine pass (horde + thunderstorm + house and car alarms + gunfire + helicopter)

Scene `--preset louisville --flag weather=storm --flag house_alarm=12 --flag car_alarm=8 --flag gunshots=2|8
[--flag gunshot_weapon=Base.AssaultRifle] --flag helicopter=true --flag route=S:25 --flag speed=1 --route-seconds 25
--record --record-audio game --asprof event=cpu,interval=5ms,threads --prop uncappedFps=true`, desktop, 5120x2160,
NVIDIA GL, zoom 2.5, direct launch; stock = the same build with `--prop enabled=false`. Details and the audio verdicts:
`findings-sound-2026-09-24.md`.

| Run | fps | p50 / p99 / p99.9 ms | > 33 ms | jitter | game / render thread | GPU | sound code (game thread) | clipped samples | Jev audio |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `snd-i4-stock-20260924-155836` (pistol) | 32.7 | 25.5 / 119.2 / 126.4 | 131 | 8.4 ms | 93 % / 52 % | 53 % | 1.3 ms / frame | 6,161 | distortion |
| `snd-i4-opt-20260924-155716` (pistol) | 115.6 | 7.7 / 28.6 / 47.8 | 16 | 2.4 ms | 97 % / 39 % | 51 % | 0.24 ms / frame | 0 | clean 0.96 |
| `snd-i6-stress-stock2-20260924-161256` (rifle, 8 shots/s) | 30.3 | 27.2 / 123.6 / 137.3 | 174 | 9.4 ms | 93 % / 51 % | 53 % | 1.38 ms / frame | 19,113 | distortion |
| `snd-i6-stress-opt-20260924-160738` (rifle, 8 shots/s) | 118.1 | 7.7 / 25.5 / 65.5 | 17 | 2.3 ms | 96 % / 40 % | 53 % | 0.28 ms / frame | 0 | clean 0.96 |

Both builds stay game-thread bound (93-97 % of a core) with the GPU half busy: below the cap with the GPU left
over, the horde's simulation is the wall, not sound. Sound code was 5.3 % of the optimized game thread before the pass
(`snd-i1-off-20260924-150826`) and is 2.7-2.9 % after (`emitterIdleSkip`: `snd-i1-on`; `soundTickHz`: `snd-i5-tick0`
vs `snd-i5-tick60`). FMOD's own threads: 0.10-0.12 of a core in every run.

## 2026-09-24 evening: render distance upstairs (`chunkGridFollowView`)

The maintainer's report: with a render distance above vanilla the screen corners are filled at the widest zoom on the
ground, but "on a higher z-level it reverts to the vanilla distance". Cause: the camera centres on the player with the
height in it, so the ground under the screen centre is 3 tiles north and 3 west of the player per level, while the
grid stays centred on the player (details: `override-edits.md`, IsoChunkMap, edit of 2026-09-24). Rig: bench mode,
`--flag start=12450,1280 --flag upstairs=4 --flag upstairs_roof=true --flag zoom=max --flag weather=clear --flag
zombies=off --shot-at 8 --prop chunkGridWidth=auto`, desktop 5120x2160, NVIDIA GL, zoom 2.5, direct launch; the
`harness: grid coverage:` console line (new) gives, for each screen corner, how many tiles its level-0 ground lies
outside the grid.

| Run | chunkGridFollowView | grid centre chunk | TL / TR / BL / BR outside (tiles) | black px in the TL wedge |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `gridz-cov4-follow-false-20260924-171020` | false | 1556,170 | 7.1 / 7.1 / 0 / 0 | 9 % |
| `gridz-cov4-follow-true-20260924-171112` | true | 1554,168 | 0 / 0 / 0 / 0 | 1 % |

Player on a flat roof at 12450,1361, level 4, grid 25 (stock 19). The wedge is mostly covered by the sidebar and a
roof drawn up from inside the grid, so the picture shows little at level 4; the numbers grow by 3 tiles per level.
The top-right corner is dark in both shots from the view cone, not the grid. No frame-time reading: screenshot runs
(the save's leftover 60 fps cap). Discarded: `gridz-lv6-*` (no level-6 room near the start, player stayed indoors on
the ground floor), `gridz-roof4-*` (no coverage line yet).
Release check on origin/master 2456dbb + the change (`gridz-rel-cov4-20260924-172608`, follow view on by default):
centre chunk 1554,168, corners 0 / 0 / 0 / 0, no exceptions.

## 2026-10-03: the 42.20 -> 42.21 drive regression (branch `perf-4221-regression`)

Runs `r4221-*` (desktop, 5120x2160, uncapped, empty tab file, `instrument=true`). Daily drive E:1200 at kmh=193, max zoom:
tree fixes off (the 42.21 port as released) 326 / 320 fps, p99 9.2-9.3 ms; on (`treeRebakeLazy`, `treeCutawayReach`,
and the since-removed `treeCutawayScissor`) 428-438 fps, p99 6.3-6.4 ms, bakes 31.5k -> 21.6k; `driveTreeCutaway=false` (42.20's tree rule)
507 / 514 fps, the 42.20.4 daily level (471-503). Storm spin on foot unchanged (271.6 vs 271.8). Proofs: `devReachCheck`
0 inside-cutaway samples from trees the reach rule keeps baked (47,720 / 35,502 probes at margin 0 / 256; control 786),
`devEdgeFastCheck` 0 of 23.9 M. Details: `docs/findings-4221-drive-regression-2026-10-03.md`.
Mac (M1 Pro, same drive, `mac-r4221-*`): released 10-02 build 118 fps, branch with fixes off 96-119, on 137-152 (p99 ~22 ->
17 ms), 42.20 rule 175; reach proof 0 violations (31,012 probes, control 444).
Hotfix (scissor removed, the cutaway draws again at every zoom; `r4221-noscis-*`, `r4221-hf-*`, `r4221-ab-*`): optimized path
2,219 trees with inside-cutaway samples (control), 0 lost by the reach rule (109,103 probes). Daily drive interleaved: passes
skipped 490 / 534 fps, drawn 504 / 498 (~2 %, inside the spread); `driveTreeCutaway=true` 405 fps.

## 2026-10-06: stock vs every optimization, Louisville horde and the Riverside horde shootout (release bc1f75d)

The last comparison after the Louisville 120 pass, on the desktop (9800X3D, RTX 4090, 5120x2160), build `bc1f75d`.
Stock = `--prop enabled=false --option frameRate=240 --option uncappedFPS=false` (stock has no uncapped mode; it reached
the cap in about 10 % of frames at most). Every optimization = the shipped defaults plus every off-by-default
performance key: `entityUpdateParallel zombieSimLodTiles=10 zombieSimLodSteps=4 zombieLodDynamic zombieLodMin3d=32
slackWork lootDefer zombieSpawnSpread zombieModelAddBudgetUs=500 animalLosSnapshot postupdateParallel zombieReuseSpread
tileRecordParallel`, uncapped. Both sides `tieredZombieUpdates=true` (the player default) and an empty options file.
Louisville = the daily `dlou` scene (population max, spinning walk, 25 s route); Riverside = the `horde-shoot` /
`dhorde` scene (Jev shoots a horde of 150, 60 s). No crash in any run.

| scene | run | fps | p99 | p99.9 | 1%-low | GPU | game thread |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Louisville | stock (fin-lou-stock1 / 2) | 36.2 / 35.0 | 67.8 / 74.1 ms | 102 / 121 ms | 12 / 11 | 36 / 35 % | 97 / 96 % |
| Louisville | every optimization (fin-lou-all1 / 2) | 155.3 / 153.6 | 19.2 / 18.5 ms | 30.0 / 31.0 ms | 50 / 52 | 55 / 53 % | 91 / 91 % |
| Riverside shootout | stock (fin-horde-stock1 / 2) | 137.5 / 130.1 | 15.4 / 19.0 ms | 27.6 / 29.0 ms | 62 / 51 | 49 / 50 % | 98 / 98 % |
| Riverside shootout | every optimization (fin-horde-all1 / 2 / 3) | 308.3 / 243.8 / 275.1 | 6.5 / 9.3 / 7.5 ms | 11.5 / 13.5 / 11.9 ms | 148 / 104 / 129 | 93 / 84 / 86 % | 86 / 88 / 87 % |

Louisville: about 36 -> 154 fps (4.3x), p99 71 -> 19 ms. Stock is game-thread bound with the GPU a third busy; with
every optimization the game thread is still the wall (91 %) at half the GPU. Riverside: about 134 -> 292 fps (2.2x,
runs 1 and 3), p99 17 -> 7 ms; optimized it is GPU-bound (86-93 %). Run 2 (244 fps) had the machine's CPU at 51 %
against 38-40 % in the others with the game's own CPU unchanged (something else was running), so it was redone (run 3);
the director plays each run differently, so the shootout varies more than the walk.

## 2026-10-09 00:00 — frame-time spikes, short drive and spin (`docs/findings-frame-spikes-2026-10-09.md`)

Desktop, 5120x2160 at **165 Hz with VRR** (no longer 240 Hz), NVIDIA GL, direct launcher, `--option frameRate=240`, zoom 2.5.
Drive = the first 487 tiles of `drive-120-south` (25 s), spin = the spin route with `--route-seconds 15`. "tab" = the
desktop's own options file (nearly every Enhancement on, HDR on, `vrrCap=false`); "def" = an empty options file (VRR cap 157).

| run | settings | fps | p99 | p99.9 | max | frames > 20 ms | GPU | game / render thread |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| spk-drive-20261008-235836 | tab, asprof + schedmon | 152 | 21.1 ms | 26.8 ms | 144 ms | 53 | 74 % | 74 / 92 % |
| spk-spin-20261008-235941 | tab, asprof + schedmon | 123 | 21.9 ms | 30.1 ms | 428 ms | 49 | 63 % | 85 / 87 % |
| spk-spin-tab-20261009-000606 | tab | 130 | 20.8 ms | 30.8 ms | 36.5 ms | 35 | 85 % | 86 / 88 % |
| spk-spin-nohdr-20261009-000708 | tab, `hdr=false hdrAuto=false` | 110 | 24.7 ms | 40.9 ms | 158 ms | 105 | 62 % | 94 / 55 % |
| spk-spin-def-20261009-000810 | defaults | 153 (cap 157) | 11.7 ms | 20.4 ms | 57.6 ms | 5 | 46 % | 68 / 39 % |

The 144 / 428 ms frames are shaders compiled on the render thread mid-play (a foliage-sway twin of a pixelLight variant; the
patched `vehicle` program for a burnt-car story's first car). The 20-35 ms frames are bake bursts with both threads already
near full every frame with the Enhancements set; with the defaults the same bursts fit.
