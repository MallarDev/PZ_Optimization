# Reflective props (2026-10-08, `mirrorsProps`, pzopt.Props)

Maintainer's request: "add reflections to all those props [the ones that are not counted as windows or mirrors but can
reflect, like glass tables]; secondary objective: make them virtually nothing; use all state-of-the-art techniques used in
other games, don't discard any idea, implement them one by one and profile them". Worktree `~/pzopt-wt/props`, branch
`prop-reflections` (from origin/master 84b483cc).

## Result (flip, Mesa radeonsi, 1920x1080, 60 fps cap; defaults)

| Scene | whole-frame GPU vs off (median) | per pass |
|---|---|---|
| showroom, 9 props, zoom 0.5, still (`prop-v12b`) | +107 us | composite 96, models 334 on 1 frame in 3, static 250 on 1 frame in ~110 |
| walking past the real kitchen / store, zoom 0.75 (`prop-walk1`) | +129 us | composite 113, static 188 on 1 frame in 30 |
| walking past real store fronts, mirrors on, props on vs off (`prop-final-true` / `-false`) | +115 us a frame (composite +93, models +13, static +10) | frame p99 17.5 / 17.5 ms, p99.9 22.8 / 22.8, GPU load 19 / 18 %, game thread 27 / 27 % of a core, render thread 22 / 21 % |

At the flip's 60 fps cap that is 0.7 % of a frame with nothing else changed (the game and render threads unchanged); the
first build cost +247 us and 289 us of render thread per composite. Not measured yet on the desktop (4090) or Windows;
the Mac never started a game this session (the released build neither: an environment problem there).

## The props

`harness/props/catalog.py` reads the tile definitions and keeps every sprite that is neither a window (`WindowN/W`,
`GlassRemovedOffset`, ...) nor an `IsMirror` tile but has glass, a screen, polished metal or glazed ceramic:

| Class | Sprites | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| glass, translucent texels | 286 | glass doors (`fixtures_doors_01/02`, the restaurant / shop brand doors, garage doors), store-front panes that are not windows (`walls_commercial_*`, Spiffo's), mall and escalator railings, shower screens, display counters and cases (shop, pie, pizza, Seahorse, theatre, cantina), the glass table, the china cabinet, the pinball glass |
| glass, opaque | 17 | glass-door fridges, the vending machines' fronts |
| screen | 22 | televisions, the security monitors, the computers, arcade cabinets, the jukebox |
| mirror | 6 | the gym's wall mirrors (`recreational_sports_01_74-79`: no `IsMirror` property, so the mirrors pass skipped them) |
| steel | 67 | steel counters, industrial / chrome sinks, stoves and ovens, microwaves, toasters, steel fridges, the 50s diner tables |
| ceramic | 38 | toilets, white and beige sinks |

Left out: the chandeliers (no depth map), the tiled bathroom walls (every bathroom wall would go per frame), neon signs.

## Geometry: every texel's own plane from the game's depth maps

A prop is not one pane: a glass counter has a glass top and two glass faces, a steel counter a top and two sides, a TV its
screen. `harness/props/masks.py` reads each sprite's depth map (`media/depthmaps/DEPTH_<tileset>.png`, else the tile
`tileDepthTextureAssignments.txt` assigns; 461 of 465 resolve). In the 2x frame a texel (X, Y) lies at u = x - y =
(X - 64) / 64, v = x + y - 6z = (Y - 192) / 32 from its square's north floor corner, with iso depth w = x + y + 2z =
4 (1 - d). A least-squares plane w = a u + b v + c over the best of five 4 x 4 windows round the texel (a texel on a fold
keeps its own face) names its face, the only three the iso camera sees:

| Face | plane | (dw/du, dw/dv) | reflected ray per square (world) | on screen |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| top | z = c | (0, 1) | (-1, -1, +1/3) | straight up the column (v -4), iso depth -4/3, climbs 1/3 level |
| south | y = c | (4/3, -1/3) | (-1, +1, -1/3) | down-left (u -2, v +2), iso depth -2/3, falls 1/3 level |
| east | x = c | (-4/3, -1/3) | (+1, -1, -1/3) | down-right |

Texels whose best fit is none of them (curved glass, a toilet bowl) are left out. The plane offset is the median of the
face's texels nearby (the depth map is 8-bit: 0.016 squares a step). Atlas: RG8, 64 x 128 per sprite, R = face << 6 |
offset ((q / 32 - 0.25) squares / levels), G = reflectance (glass: every face texel, the sprite's translucent texels decide
at run time; opaque glass: light grey-blue; screens: the largest dark blob on a vertical face; steel: low-saturation grey;
ceramic: white). `props.txt` adds the class, the mode and the main vertical face (for the mirrored people).

## Design

The props are a third kind of reflector in pzopt.Mirrors' pipeline (findings-mirrors-2026-10-03.md):
1. Drawn per frame (`Mirrors.perFrame`: most are already, `glassTilesPerFrame`), captured as they draw (their quad, the
   atlas cell, the flip: a flipped sprite's south and east faces swap).
2. Static pass (every 4th frame, the atlas tile kept while the scene holds): every reflective texel's pane point from its
   face's plane; a top marches up its column (no floor shortcut: the ray never comes down), a south / east face as a pane
   of that orientation (the mirrors' march: floor first, then taps and bisection). Glass marched at half resolution.
3. Composite: the props in a second instanced draw after the panes; no analytic plane for the hardware depth test (a prop
   has several faces), so each texel tests its own surface depth against the frame's depth (read as a texture, depth writes
   off): glass writes no depth, whoever stands behind it passes, whoever stands in front hides it.
4. The mirrored characters / vehicles in the prop's main vertical face (doors, store fronts, screens, fridges).

## Techniques measured

Machine: the flip (Ayaneo Flip, AMD APU, Mesa 26.2 radeonsi, 1920x1080, 60 fps cap; the GL 4.3 path, untested there before).
Scene: the outdoor showroom (9 props in a row 3 squares north of the player, the sheriff car beside him), zoom 0.5, still camera;
same-run cycles of `devMirrorsAlternate=1000` (`harness/mirrors/cost.py`: whole-frame GPU per period, per-pass GPU timers).

| Step | Run | Result |
|---|---|---|
| first build: whole frame GPU vs mirrors off | `prop-v2` | +247 us median; composite 238 us, model pass 646 us on frames it draws, static pass 386 us on 1 frame in ~35 |
| render thread: the data rows uploaded from client memory | `prop-v1` | **289 us a composite** in `glTexSubImage2D`: Mesa's threaded GL waits for its driver thread on a client-memory upload |
| data rows through a persistently mapped unpack buffer (`mirrorsPboUpload`) | `prop-v2` | upload 289 -> **5 us** |
| composite: per-pane rows fetched once per vertex, flat to the fragments (`mirrorsFlatRows`) | `prop-v3` vs `-noflat` | 234 -> 227 us: not the cost |
| composite split (dev bit 4194304, no prop composite) | `prop-v3` | panes 9.5 us, **props 218 us** |
| props' occlusion through `gl_FragDepth` + the hardware depth test instead of reading the frame's depth as a texture (`mirrorsPropDepthWrite`) | `prop-v4` | props 218 -> **110 us** (reading the depth buffer makes AMD decompress it); whole frame +230 -> **+123 us** |
| mirrored models: one draw per orientation into a scratch impostor, the whole box copied per plane with its depth texture (`mirrorsModelShare` v1) | `prop-v5` | model pass 1218 -> **2012 us** (worse: box-sized copies x 5 planes + another depth decompress) |
| glossy 8-tap blur in the composite (dev bit 33554432 off) | `prop-v5` | props composite 124 -> 91 us without it: the blur is ~33 us |
| model share v2: one copy per (model, plane) clipped to the plane's panes, at the model centre's depth (no depth texture, early-Z kept; the scratch depth a renderbuffer) | `prop-v6` | model pass 1223 -> **978 us** per drawn frame |
| prop quads cut to their reflective texels' box (`mirrorsPropTightQuads`, the box from masks.py) | `prop-v6` | static pass 316 -> 257 us, composite 123 -> 110 us |
| mirrored models at half resolution when no silvered mirror is on screen (`mirrorsGlassModelScalePct` 50) | `prop-v7` | model pass 976 -> **322 us** per drawn frame |
| static pass without its draws (dev bit 512) | `prop-v7` | 379 -> 8 us: the static pass is the march itself (10 props new together every ~31 frames), not a fixed cost on Mesa |
| props re-marched every 240 frames (`mirrorsPropStaticReuse`; a prop's reflection changes only when the world does, a pan never invalidates a tile) + the pass's marched area capped (`mirrorsStaticBudgetPct` 3 % of the viewport) | `prop-v8` | static passes 1 in ~31 -> 1 in ~110 frames, 250 us each; whole frame **+108 us** median |
| glossy as a pre-convolved mip chain of the atlas, one `textureLod` tap (`mirrorsPropGloss=mip`) | `prop-v8-mip` | composite 100 -> 96 us, but the mip build adds ~110 us to each glossy static pass: kept as an option, blur stays |
| glossy baked at the static pass: 4 rays jittered round the mirror direction by the roughness, averaged (`mirrorsPropGloss=bake`, general-direction march `marchDir`) | `prop-v9-bake` | composite 100 -> 96 us, static 250 -> 327 us: true glossy, kept as an option |
| composite split, constant colour (dev bit 8) | `prop-v10-z0.5` / `-z1` | props 95 us at zoom 0.5 (53 fixed per-pixel: raster, the mask read, the depth export, the blend; 42 shading), 40 us at zoom 1 (26 / 14): fill, scales with the px |
| props smaller than `mirrorsPropMinPx` (600 px) on screen skipped (zoomed out) | | no march, no composite for props a few px wide |
| conservative depth: the props' quads at their square's nearest depth, `layout(depth_greater) out float gl_FragDepth` (`mirrorsPropConservativeDepth`) | `prop-v12b` vs `-v11` | composite 99 -> 96 us (noise; it pays where something stands in front of a prop). The first try declared it before an `#extension` line: NVIDIA linked, **Mesa refused, the flip ran with mirrors off** (`prop-v12`); MirrorsShaderTest now also links every program with Mesa llvmpipe |
| Hi-Z: the nearest scene per 16 x 16 px block built at each static pass, the march jumps over blocks the scene stands behind (`mirrorsHiZ`, off) | `prop-hiz-false` / `-true2` | static pass 370 -> **802 us**: the build (256 depth reads a block over the screen) and the extra fetch per tap cost more than the 4-32-tap rays save. The first build looped forever on the GPU (`ceil` of a float index stepped back; the flip's game hung at frame 211) |
| glossy in the real kitchen (steel counters, sink; zoom 0.5, props re-marched every 30 frames for samples): blur vs bake + history (each refresh turns the jitter and blends into the tile at 34 %: the tiles do not move with the camera, so the history needs no reprojection; `mirrorsPropGlossAccumPct`) | `prop-gloss-blur` / `-bake` | composite 236 -> **189 us**, static 309 -> 326 us a pass; at the default 240-frame refresh bake is ~40 us a frame cheaper and looks the same or better: **bake is the default** |
| walking past the real kitchen / store (`find=props` cluster 1, route W:8, zoom 0.75) | `prop-walk1` | whole frame +129 us median; composite 113 us; static pass 188 us on 1 frame in 30 (props coming on screen); 10,718 hidden pane-frames skipped |

### Look

| Change | Why |
|---|---|
| steel tinted (x 0.55, F0 of steel), roughness 60 %, strength 25 %, blur radius from (hit distance + 1 square) | the kitchen's steel counters read as see-through (the floor tiles continued in their fronts, the striped wall sharp in their top) |
| a prop's reflection times its own light (its vertex colour; since the rebase onto 75754f83 the mirrors' own `paneLight`, which also hides panes in rooms the player never saw) | a counter out of the player's sight, drawn near black, took a light grey reflection |
| opaque glass on vertical faces only; translucent glass only where it is light (shadows are dark); nothing at floor height is a top | the fridge's grey cap reflected; a glass table's soft drop shadow reflected the sky as blue notches on the floor |
| the gym's mirrors treated as mirror tiles (`mirrorsPropMirrorAsMirror`): the room rebuilt behind the glass, people placed as in a mirror | they are silvered mirrors without the `IsMirror` property |
| an outdoor top's misses show the sky (the skybox gradient at its fixed mirror direction, north-west 30 degrees up) plus a GGX sun lobe (`mirrorsPropSky`) | glass tables outdoors reflected nothing; a flat top of the iso camera can only ever catch a low north-western sun |

### Steel, ceramic and screens: people only (2026-10-09, maintainer: "steel surfaces still look translucent")

Every way of showing the static scene on an opaque prop read as see-through: mirrored by a vertical face in the iso view, the
floor continues the floor beside the prop, and a top's mirrored wall continues the wall above it. Tried on the desktop in the
real kitchen and the showroom (runs `metal-*` .. `metal6-*`):

| Composite | Look |
|---|---|
| the reflection blended over the steel (alpha), tinted x 0.55 | translucent: the floor tiles in the cabinet fronts, the striped wall in the top |
| the reflection's brightness as a modulation of the steel's own colour (blend `GL_DST_COLOR, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA`) | the steel keeps its look, but the bright kitchen lifts the whole face: a lighter, see-through-looking sheet |
| the same with the baked jittered rays at 90 % roughness | sparkling grain |
| the modulation by the variation round a 16 px mean (zero mean) | the asphalt's texture on the counter's face: see-through again |
| **only the mirrored people / cars, as their brightness against the static reflection under them** (`mirrorsPropMetalBlend`) | solid, as stock; whoever walks by shows as a soft smudge |

A dark TV screen showed the asphalt the same way: screens joined the group. The glass keeps the whole reflection (it is
see-through). Found in the same runs: the opaque props drawn per frame wrote no depth (the translucent pass), so a glass
table's reflection behind the TV was drawn over the TV; they now write their depth as their baked selves did
(`mirrorsPropDepth`, override-edits.md). The glossy default became `mip` (the steel's own blur, rarely used now).

### People mirrored in the tops (`mirrorsPropTopModels`)

A top z = c is a plane of the model pass too (the camera's reflection in the model frame: y' = 2 yc - y). Two findings:
- the character model's frame stands 0.72 units off its feet (its -0.48 x 1.5 offset): the first images came out 0.31 levels
  too high (layer read back with `devMirrorsLog`: 699..942 px against 463..704 predicted; with the offset 473..717).
  `mirrorsTopModelYPct` 72 (vehicles 0, not yet checked).
- a prop's top and its front face stand side by side on screen, so a model's images in both overlapped in the one layer: the
  tops have a layer of their own (two passes of the model flush).
- the iso geometry limits it: a top's ray goes straight back and climbs a third of a level a square, so a standing person shows
  only in the strip of a top within ~0.8 squares in front of them (`prop-top15`: the legs in the table top behind them).
- dev views 7 / 8 (the raw layers over the reflector quads) must write `gl_FragDepth` on their early return in the props'
  program, or nothing draws (the first probes looked empty for that reason).

## Open: sliding glass door leaves do not reflect (2026-10-09, maintainer: "I'll tackle it later")

Found making the Workshop card (`harness/props-reflect-card.py`, runs `gpc2-stock-cap` / `gpc2-enh-cap`, the Rosewood back
yard with two sliding doors at 7951,11503-04 and 11507-08): only half of each sliding glass door reflects. A sliding door is
two tiles:

| Part | Sprites | Tile data | Reflects |
|---|---|---|---|
| fixed pane | `fixtures_doors_01_104-107` (brown frame), `112-115` (white) | `WindowW` / `windowW`, `MaterialType=Glass`, `GlassRemovedOffset` | yes, as a window (the mirrors' window path) |
| sliding leaf | `fixtures_doors_01_108-111` (brown), `116-119` (white) | `Material=Door`, `doorW` / `doorN`, `doorTrans`, no glass word anywhere; only `DoorSound=SlidingGlassDoor` tells it | no |

`harness/props/catalog.py` skips the leaves: `classify()` drops window tiles and tests only the material / group / name
fields for "glass". Fix to try: class `glass` for `DoorSound=SlidingGlassDoor` tiles without a window key (or name the 8
sprites), rerun `masks.py` (the open-state sprites 110/111, 118/119 are mostly frame: check their masks), rebuild, and check
the leaf as an IsoDoor in both states (open / closed, the open one drawn as `doorTrans`); then a release. Other glass doors
whose tile data has no glass word may be missing the same way: list the doors (`DoorSound`, `doorTrans`) the catalog leaves
out. Repro: the card's walk (`walk=7951.0,11502.3;7951.0,11508.3`, `start=7952,11503`, zoom 0.5, noon), compare the two
halves of the door at 7951,11507-08 (the player's image shows in the lower-left pane only).

## Rigs

- `harness/props/catalog.py --sheet`, `masks.py --sheet` (faces coloured: top yellow, south cyan, east magenta).
- Showroom: `--flag start=8147,11507 --flag place_tile=location_shop_generic_01_96@8144,11505/furniture_tables_low_01_8@8145,11505/appliances_television_01_1@8146,11505/fixtures_counters_01_33@8147,11505/recreational_sports_01_74@8148,11505/appliances_refrigeration_01_18@8149,11505/fixtures_doors_01_37@8150,11505/fixtures_bathroom_01_2@8151,11505`.
- `tests/pzopt/MirrorsShaderTest.java`: every Mirrors program (GL 4.3 and 4.1) links with the real driver headless.
- `devMirrorsPropSkip` (the measurements above used `devMirrorsSkip` bits, which the mirrors' room pass took over on the
  same day): 1 props not captured, 2 quads not cut to their reflective box, 4 data rows from client memory, 8 no prop
  composite, 16 mirrored models at full resolution, 32 no model share. Dev views 7 / 8: the raw model / top layer over every
  reflector quad. `devMirrorsTopTest` (1 no scissor, 2 no depth test) for the top layer pass; `devMirrorsLog` reads the
  layer back once (its drawn box).
- `--flag find=props [find_rank=N]`: the route starts beside the N-th densest cluster of reflective props within 80 tiles.
- `harness/stitch-props.sh`: the stock-look vs reflections-on video (`docs/media/prop-reflections-stock-vs-on.mp4`) from
  eight flip `devCapture` runs `pv-<show|kitchen|store|tables>-<false|true>`.
